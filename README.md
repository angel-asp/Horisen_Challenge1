## Description

This is a legit website for a fake maketing agentcy, why you may ask? Well to practice organizing & making semantic HTML elemets, adding commits to CSS sheets, making ALT tags for images, and a few more orgainazion skills and bug squashing. I learn better by working at my own pace and googling (is that a word?) things to finsh a project. Down below I will site some useful websites I used to complete this project.
